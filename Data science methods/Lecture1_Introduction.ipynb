    "> An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, namely a compiler or an interpreter.\n",

    "- You can also just start a python shell by just running ``python``, i.e. calling the python interpreter\n",
    "- However, it might be more useful to work with **IPython** which is also the underlying interpreter of **jupyter notebooks**. In the Anaconda Powershell Promt you call it via ``ipython3``"

    "Here we find several new features of python. Let's go through them step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function is defined by the key-word ``def`` followed by the name of the function and in brackets the arguments, which the function requires as input (here to variables named x and y). These variables are available inside the function for manipulation. \n",
    "2. The colon marks the end of the defining line of the function. The next line starts with an indent (4 spaces or a tab). This is always the case in python after colons. Indentation is generally used to group lines of code together in python, here the core of the function ``maximum``. It replaces the extensive usage of brackets in other programming languages and makes code easily readable as the user is forced to use indents.\n",
    "3. Inside the function, we have an ``if``, ``elif``, ``else`` statement. They are simple conditional statements. If ``True``, than the followin code is executed. If ``False``, the next statement (``elif``) is tested until we reach ``else``, which is executed only if none of the previous ``if`` or ``elif`` statements was ``True``.\n",
    "4. The keyword ``return`` marks the return value of the function. Whenever executed, the function is terminated and the ``return`` statement is then available as the output of the function.\n",
    "5. Last, the function contains a built-in exception (``ValueError``), i.e. an Error message, which is returned as soon as both variables are either no numbers (such that no maximum exists), or if the numbers are equal. It is used together with the ``raise`` statement, which terminates the execution of the code at that point, where the error is raised. \n",

However, as the variable ``a`` is modified in the meantime to have the same value as ``b``, no maximum can be found and the function raises an error. Python execution is **aborted** and the error message points us to the line of code, where the execution fails. This can be extremely helpful in big prograqmming projects. In addition, Errors can be programmed such, that certain types of Errors can be handeled and do not directly induce the program to fail.
